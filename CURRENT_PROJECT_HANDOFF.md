# Guardian Research — CURRENT PROJECT HANDOFF

**Canonical current state: 2026-09-22**

## Closed / frozen lineages
- V100 forward/shadow frozen; 2026 protected.
- Rates standalone closed after V103 forensic 0/5.
- CFTC standalone closed after V105 report-level forensic 0/7.
- ALFRED V107 closed operationally without alpha conclusion.
- Treasury V109 closed at discovery.

## V110 / V111 — PRE-OOS FORENSIC PASS

V110 run:
GEF110-20260922-162255

V111 run:
GEF111-20260922-163321

V111 passed exactly 3 of the 8 validated V110 candidates:

1. C3 — AUDUSD H21, 120m, SHORT
2. C4 — USDCHF H23, 240m, LONG
3. C6 — USDCHF H23, 120m, LONG

These correspond to 2 structural information families:
- AUDUSD|H21
- USDCHF|H23

Do not count the two USDCHF horizons as independent edges.

Failed V111 candidates:
- XAGUSD H11 60m
- USDJPY H22 Thursday 120m
- USDCHF H22 240m
- AUDUSD H21 240m
- EURUSD H11 120m

## V112 — PREREGISTERED, HUMAN APPROVED, READY TO RUN

V112 protocol is frozen before any 2023-2025 market return is opened.

Frozen OOS candidates:
- AUDUSD H21 120m SHORT
- USDCHF H23 120m LONG
- USDCHF H23 240m LONG

Candidate OOS gate requires all:
- N >= 500
- directional mean > 0
- matched-control effect > 0
- net 1 bp > 0
- trim best 2% > 0
- leave-one-year-out minimum > 0
- month-block bootstrap q2.5 > 0

Family rule:
- AUDUSD|H21 passes if its frozen candidate passes.
- USDCHF|H23 passes only if BOTH 120m and 240m frozen candidates pass.

The runner will not open any 2023-2025 market file unless invoked with:
OPEN_LOCKED_OOS_2023_2025

2026 remains forbidden.

No automatic execution.
No optimization after OOS.
No portfolio construction in V112.


### Human gate opened
On 2026-09-22 the user explicitly approved opening locked OOS 2023-2025.
The protocol, candidates and gates remain unchanged.
2026 remains forbidden.


### V112.1 boundary correction
The first unlocked V112 run opened 2023-2025 raw files but stopped before candidate scoring because right-labelled 5-minute resampling produced a synthetic 2026-01-01 00:00 output label from late-2025 raw rows.
2023-2025 is therefore now consumed.
No 2026 raw file was opened.
V112.1 clips the resampled output back to <2026-01-01 and leaves the frozen scientific protocol unchanged.
