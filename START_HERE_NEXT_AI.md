Read only what is needed, in this order:

1. `GUARDIAN_STATE.json`
2. `docs/OPERATOR_POWERSHELL_HANDOFF_WORKFLOW.md`
3. `GUARDIAN_MASTER_MANDATE.md`
4. `research/experiments/D045.json`

## Current P0

- Experiment: **D045-D1-DONCHIAN-20-10-BENCHMARK-V0**
- State: **READY_SMOKE**
- Next action: **On the MT5 research PC run `git pull` then `py -3 .\research\runner\guardian_research.py campaign D045 --stage smoke`. Smoke is engineering-only on USDJPY/XAUUSD/BTCUSD for 2023-08-01..2023-10-31 in Model=0. Do not inspect smoke profitability. The campaign recompiles the exact frozen D045 source, runs the three smoke symbols, validates native Trade Path and publishes automatically. After completion the user should only say `fini`; the assistant reads `backtests/d045/live/latest.json`. Development remains locked until smoke engineering integrity passes.**

## Canonical operator UX

- Prefer one short PowerShell command block.
- The runner publishes results automatically to `backtest-results`.
- The user normally responds only **`fini`**.
- The assistant then retrieves GitHub evidence, updates state, and gives the next minimal command.
- Do not ask the user to paste logs/JSON when automatic transport succeeded.

## Operational truths

- Codex required: **NO**
- Guardian Core baseline: **v12.01** — do not modify during this research refactor.
- Legacy AutoSync: **UNTRUSTED_NEVER_RELIABLY_WORKED** — reference only, never fallback.
- AutoSync target: **AUTOSYNC_V3_FROM_SCRATCH**.
- Closed experiments: D017=REJECTED_ALPHA_FAMILY, D023=REJECTED_UNTOUCHED_CONFIRMATION, D036=REJECTED_V0, D037=REJECTED_V0, D038=REJECTED_V0_COUNT_GATE_ONLY_RICH_PATH_RETAINED, D039=REJECTED_V0_COUNT_GATE_ONLY_RICH_PATH_RETAINED, D040=UNCONFIRMED_2026_H1_ARCHIVED.

If this file ever disagrees with `GUARDIAN_STATE.json`, the state file wins and this file must be regenerated with:
