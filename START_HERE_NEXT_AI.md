Read only what is needed, in this order:

1. `GUARDIAN_STATE.json`
2. `GUARDIAN_MASTER_MANDATE.md`
3. `research/experiments/D037.json`
4. `research/campaigns/D037_WILLIAMS_PREVDAY_RANGE_VOLATILITY_BREAKOUT_V0_PREREGISTRATION_2026_09_06.md`
5. `production/guardian/GUARDIAN_CORE_V12_01_COMPILE_VALIDATED_2026_09_06.md`

## Current P0

- Experiment: **D037-WILLIAMS-PREVDAY-RANGE-VOLATILITY-BREAKOUT-V0**
- State: **COMPILE_PENDING**
- Next action: **On the MT5 research PC: pull D037 v1.02, compile it with source/destination SHA proof and MetaEditor 0 errors / 0 warnings, then run exactly one XAUUSD development integrity test. Only if XAUUSD finishes FINAL with zero integrity counters should the six-symbol DEV batch be restarted from scratch.**

## Operational truths

- Codex required: **NO**
- Guardian Core baseline: **v12.01** — do not modify during this research refactor.
- Legacy AutoSync: **UNTRUSTED_NEVER_RELIABLY_WORKED** — reference only, never fallback.
- AutoSync target: **AUTOSYNC_V3_FROM_SCRATCH**.
- Closed experiments: D017=REJECTED_ALPHA_FAMILY, D023=REJECTED_UNTOUCHED_CONFIRMATION, D036=REJECTED_V0.
