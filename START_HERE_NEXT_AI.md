> **GENERATED COMPATIBILITY ENTRYPOINT. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND.**
> Authoritative state: `GUARDIAN_STATE.json`.

Read only what is needed, in this order:

1. `GUARDIAN_STATE.json`
2. `GUARDIAN_MASTER_MANDATE.md`
3. `research/experiments/D037.json`
4. `research/campaigns/D037_WILLIAMS_PREVDAY_RANGE_VOLATILITY_BREAKOUT_V0_PREREGISTRATION_2026_09_06.md`
5. `production/guardian/GUARDIAN_CORE_V12_01_COMPILE_VALIDATED_2026_09_06.md`

## Current P0

- Experiment: **D037-WILLIAMS-PREVDAY-RANGE-VOLATILITY-BREAKOUT-V0**
- State: **READY_DEV**
- Next action: **Restart the sequential six-symbol D037 v1.02 development batch from scratch with reference tester model 0. Stop immediately on any engineering/integrity failure. If all six runs pass integrity, score the frozen DEV gates; any failed gate means REJECT_V0 with no rescue tuning.**

## Operational truths

- Codex required: **NO**
- Guardian Core baseline: **v12.01** — do not modify during this research refactor.
- Legacy AutoSync: **UNTRUSTED_NEVER_RELIABLY_WORKED** — reference only, never fallback.
- AutoSync target: **AUTOSYNC_V3_FROM_SCRATCH**.
- Closed experiments: D017=REJECTED_ALPHA_FAMILY, D023=REJECTED_UNTOUCHED_CONFIRMATION, D036=REJECTED_V0.
